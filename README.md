# misc-js
This repository contains a collection of small jQuery plugins, minor JavaScript
and jQuery patches, and other miscellaneous code samples conveniently placed in
one spot.

Currently, the repository contains the following:

## jQuery

*   jQuery.getLength - Used to find the length of Strings (character count),
    Arrays (element count) and Objects (property count, excluding prototype-
    inherited properties).
*   jQuery.isEmpty - Used to find out whether or not a String (zero character
    length), Array (no elements) or Object (no properties) is "empty."
*   jQuery.isNumber - Used to determine if a value is truly, in fact, a number.
